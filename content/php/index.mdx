PHP stants for "Hypertext preprocessor" and is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.

Although PHP's development is focused on server-side scripting, you can do much more with it. Read on, and see more in the [What can PHP do?](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro-whatcando.php) section, or go right to the [introductory tutorial](https://www.php.net/manual/en/tutorial.php) if you are only interested in web programming.
