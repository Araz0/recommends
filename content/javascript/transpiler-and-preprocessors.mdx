### Babel

a JavaScript compiler that allows you to use next generation JavaScript, today. Babel is nowadays the de-facto standard for writing modular and testable JavaScript.
Babel isn't a framework, but a compiler. You won't have to learn it to use it but you will need to understand how JavaScript works.

### TypeScript

a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It is definitely overwhelming at first and again if you are not familiar with JavaScript then it is not a great choice to use it.

### CoffeeScript

a little and simplified language that compiles into JavaScript.
