import { OpengraphCard } from '../../src/components/opengraphCard';

In the learning section you will find a list of books, courses and cheatcheets. I know technically cheatsheets aren’t really to learn but the more you use them the less you will use them.

## Books

- JavaScript: The Good Parts by O’Reilly
- HTML & CSS - Design and build Websites by Jon Duckett
- JavaScript & jQuery - interactive front-end web development by Jon Duckett
