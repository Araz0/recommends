[Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/journal/13844) definition of a design system:

> The generally-accepted definition of a design system is that itâ€™s the outer circleâ€”it encompasses pattern libraries, style guides, and any other artifacts. But thereâ€™s something more. Just because you have a collection of design patterns doesnâ€™t mean you have a design system. A system is a framework. Itâ€™s a rulebook. Itâ€™s what tells you how those patterns work together.
